# OpenTower UI/UX Overhaul

## Current State Audit

### ✅ What's Working:
- TopBar: Functional layout with clear info sections
- BottomBar: Good notification system and tool selection
- BuildingMenu: Simple but effective building selection
- Structure is solid, just needs polish

### ❌ What Needs Improvement:

1. **Typography**
   - Using Arial/monospace - too generic
   - No visual hierarchy with font weights/sizes
   - Need gaming-appropriate fonts

2. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Everything has similar visual weight
   - Important info (funds, star rating) doesn't stand out
   - Needs better spacing and grouping

3. **Hover States**
   - Basic but not satisfying
   - Need smoother transitions
   - Could use more visual feedback

4. **Building Tooltips**
   - Functional but plain
   - Could be more visually appealing
   - Info layout could be clearer

5. **Star Rating**
   - Just emoji, not prominent enough
   - Should be a focal point
   - Needs better visual treatment

6. **Building Placement Preview**
   - Ghost preview works but could be clearer
   - Validity indicators need improvement
   - Cost display during placement missing

## Improvements Made:

### 1. Typography System
- **Primary font**: 'Segoe UI', 'Roboto' (clean, readable)
- **Accent font**: 'Courier New', monospace (for numbers/technical)
- **Font scales**: 10px (tiny) → 24px (huge)
- **Font weights**: 400 (normal), 600 (semi-bold), 700 (bold)

### 2. Color Palette (Game-Inspired)
- **Background**: Deep gradients (#1a1a1a → #2a2a2a)
- **Accent colors**:
  - Funds: #FFD700 (gold) with green tints
  - Population: #64B5F6 (blue)
  - Star rating: #FFA726 (amber)
  - Income: #4CAF50 (green)
