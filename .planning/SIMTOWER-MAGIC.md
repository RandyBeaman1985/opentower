# SimTower Magic - What Made It Special

## 🎯 Core Magic (from research)

### 1. PERSONAL SCALE
- Follow INDIVIDUAL people through their day
- Name and color-code specific tenants
- Feel loss when someone moves out
- Watch reviewers tour your hotel
- Observe maids cleaning rooms

### 2. INTIMATE PROBLEMS (not abstract stats)
- "My neighbors are too loud"
- "The elevator is too slow"
- "My parking spot is inconvenient"
- Noise complaints between floor types
- Individual satisfaction, not aggregate

### 3. DAY/NIGHT RHYTHM
- Sun rises → businesses open
- Sun sets → everyone goes home
- Rush hour elevator chaos
- Night shift workers vs day workers
- Hotels busiest at night, offices by day

### 4. ELEVATOR OBSESSION
- The HEART of the game
- Express vs local elevators
- Sky lobbies for transfers
- Watching stress levels
- Optimizing routes like a puzzle

### 5. PROGRESSIVE UNLOCKS
- Start with basics (lobby, office, stairs)
- Star rating unlocks new buildings
- Cathedral at floor 100 = victory
- Each star feels like an achievement

### 6. CLICK-AND-DRAG SIMPLICITY
- Click → drag → release = building placed
- No complex menus mid-flow
- Instant visual feedback
- Satisfying "snap" to grid
