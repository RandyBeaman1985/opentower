## 💡 TIPS FOR CONSISTENT RESULTS

1. **Save seeds** - Note the seed of good images, use "Seed: X" in prompt
2. **Batch generate** - Make 4 variations, pick best, regenerate with seed
3. **Color matching** - Post-process in Aseprite to unify palette
4. **Grid alignment** - Always resize to exact pixel dimensions after generation
5. **State variants** - Generate base, then describe differences for states

### Post-Processing Checklist
- [ ] Resize to exact dimensions (576×64, 256×64, etc.)
- [ ] Remove background (make transparent)
- [ ] Reduce colors to 16-32 palette
- [ ] Clean up edges (no anti-aliasing artifacts)
- [ ] Check alignment to 64px grid
- [ ] Save as PNG-32 with transparency
