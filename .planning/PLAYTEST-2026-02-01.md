# OpenTower Playtest Report
**Date:** February 1, 2026 8:30 AM MST  
**Version:** v0.5.0 (Visual Polish Sprint)  
**Session Type:** Three-Perspective Panel Review  

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Assessment: 7/10** - Solid foundation with satisfying core loop, but needs variety, visual polish, and critical bug fixes before public release.

### Key Findings:
- ✅ **Core simulation is excellent** - Elevator LOOK algorithm, stress system, economic loop all work well
- ✅ **v0.5.0 polish is noticeable** - Queue visualization, particle effects, better sprites
- ⚠️ **8 new bugs found** - 3 critical (stuck people, elevator demolish, no pop cap)
- ⚠️ **UX gaps for new players** - Need error messages, tooltips, goal reminders
- ❌ **Visual style hurts immersion** - Colored rectangles don't evoke SimTower nostalgia

## Detailed Reviews

### 👤 Perspective 1: Casual Gamer
**"Would a new player understand what to do?"**

**Clarity Rating: 6.5/10**

**Strengths:**
- Tutorial system (4 steps) explains basics well
- Building menu shows costs and keyboard shortcuts clearly
- HUD displays all key metrics (funds, population, time)
- Tower Pulse widget provides real-time health monitoring
- Help button (?) allows reopening tutorial

**Pain Points:**
1. **No error feedback** - Ghost preview turns red but doesn't explain WHY (not enough funds? overlap? wrong floor?)
2. **Elevator placement confusing** - Tutorial doesn't explain drag-to-select-height mechanic. Players might click instead of dragging.
3. **No goal persistence** - Tutorial mentions "reach 3★" but there's no constant reminder or progress tracker
4. **Queue visualization subtle** - Red badges exist but easy to miss
5. **Missing tooltips** - HUD elements like "Cash Flow $/day" unexplained

**Recommendation:**  
Add contextual error messages and persistent goal tracker. Tutorial is 80% there, but needs 2-3 more tooltips for polish.

### 🏢 Perspective 2: SimTower Veteran
**"Does this capture SimTower's feel?"**

**Authenticity Rating: 7.5/10**

**What's Authentic:**
- ✅ Elevator LOOK algorithm (exactly like original)
- ✅ Stress system with visual feedback (black → pink → red)
- ✅ Quarterly income collection (15 game-minutes)
- ✅ Star rating progression (1★ → 5★)
- ✅ Day/night cycle with building lights
- ✅ Hotel check-in/check-out mechanics
- ✅ Condo residents with work schedules
- ✅ Food buildings reduce stress
- ✅ Population growth based on tower success

**Missing from SimTower:**
- ❌ Cathedral / Tower of Babel (end-game goal)
- ❌ Underground parking garages
- ❌ Movie theaters (entertainment)
- ❌ Metro station (transportation hub)
- ❌ Security office
- ❌ Noise complaints / neighbor mechanics
- ❌ Christmas events (Santa visits)
- ❌ Terrorist events (controversial but iconic)

**Where This Game Is BETTER:**
1. **Tutorial system** - Original had none
2. **Save/load that works** - SimTower's save was buggy
3. **Auto-immigration** - Less tedious than paying for ads
4. **Food reduces stress** - Logical addition
5. **Modern UX** - Keyboard shortcuts, tooltips, undo

**Visual Comparison:**
- Original: Isometric pixel art with detailed building sprites
- Current: Top-down colored rectangles (programmer art)
- **Gap:** Visual style doesn't evoke nostalgia yet

**Missing ~30% of building variety** hurts replayability.

**Recommendation:**  
Focus on visual upgrade next (ImageFX sprites). Building variety can come in v0.7-0.9.

### 🐛 Perspective 3: QA Tester
**"Find bugs, edge cases, performance issues"**

### Critical Bugs (Fix Immediately)

#### BUG-014: Can't Demolish Elevators ⚠️
- **Impact:** Memory leak + players can't experiment
- **Repro:** Place elevator, press D, click shaft → nothing happens
- **Root Cause:** Demolish only checks buildings, not elevator system
- **Fix Time:** 30 minutes
- **Priority:** P0

#### BUG-013: People Get Stuck Forever ⚠️
- **Impact:** Workers spawn on unreachable floors, stress maxes out, ruins gameplay
- **Repro:** Place office on floor 5, no elevator → worker stuck waiting
- **Root Cause:** Pathfinding returns null but person never despawns
- **Fix Time:** 1 hour
- **Priority:** P0

#### BUG-017: No Population Cap ⚠️
- **Impact:** Performance death spiral at 5000+ people
- **Repro:** Run game 1 hour at max speed
- **Root Cause:** Auto-immigration has no ceiling
- **Fix Time:** 15 minutes
- **Priority:** P1

### High-Priority Bugs

#### BUG-015: Stress Never Decays
- **Impact:** Gameplay feels punishing. One bad wait = stressed forever
- **Fix:** Add -1 stress/tick when idle, -5/tick when eating

#### BUG-012: Elevator Drag Gives No Feedback
- **Impact:** Players confused when 1-floor elevator doesn't place
- **Fix:** Show tooltip "Elevators need at least 2 floors"

### Low-Priority Bugs

#### BUG-011: Elevator Capacity Not Visual
- **Fix:** Show "3/15" instead of just "3"

#### BUG-016: People Overlap During Boarding
- **Fix:** Staggered boarding delay (50ms per person)

#### BUG-018: Sound Might Play When Muted
- **Fix:** Verify all `play*()` methods check `enabled` flag

### Performance Analysis

**Architecture Quality: ✅ Good**
- Simulation (100ms ticks) decoupled from rendering (60fps)
- Fixed timestep with accumulator pattern
- Sprite pooling implemented

**Bottlenecks:**
1. **PopulationSystem.update()** - O(n) over all people every tick
   - At 1000 people: manageable
   - At 5000+ people: likely lag
   - **Fix:** Spatial partitioning or dirty flags

2. **PathfindingSystem** - No route caching
   - Recalculates every time person needs destination
   - **Fix:** Cache common routes (office → food building)

3. **PeopleRenderer** - Rebuilds graphics every frame
   - **Fix:** Only redraw on state change

**Current Performance: 7/10**
- Should run smoothly up to 1000 population
- Needs optimization for 5000+
- No spatial partitioning yet

---

## Edge Cases Found

1. **Dead-end scenario:** Player runs out of money with 0 income → no bankruptcy/game-over state
2. **Stuck elevators:** If player demolishes floor under active elevator, shaft might break
3. **Stress spiral:** 100 offices + 0 elevators = mass critical stress → star rating death spiral (intended difficulty but harsh)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (v0.5.1 Hotfix - 2 hours)
1. ✅ Fix BUG-014 (elevator demolish) - 30 min
2. ✅ Fix BUG-013 (stuck people) - 1 hour
3. ✅ Add BUG-017 (population cap) - 15 min
4. ✅ Add error messages for invalid placement - 15 min

### Short-term (v0.6.0 - 1 day)
1. ✅ Visual upgrade: Replace rectangles with ImageFX sprites
   - Generate pixel art for: office, condo, hotel, food, shop
   - Day/night variants
   - ~3-4 hours
2. ✅ Fix BUG-015 (stress decay)
3. ✅ Add persistent goal tracker ("2★ Progress: 73/100 population")

### Medium-term (v0.7.0 - 1 week)
1. ✅ Add missing SimTower buildings (cathedral, parking, metro, theaters)
2. ✅ Performance optimization (route caching, sprite caching)
3. ✅ Tutorial expansion (elevator drag explained)

## Fun Factor Breakdown

**What Makes It Fun (Keep This!):**
- ✅ Core loop: build → earn → expand → unlock
- ✅ Elevator management creates strategic decisions
- ✅ Stress system adds challenge without being punishing (once decay is added)
- ✅ Visual polish (sparkles, animations, queue visualization)
- ✅ Auto-save prevents frustration
- ✅ Immigration feels organic

**What Hurts Fun (Fix This):**
- ❌ Placeholder graphics break immersion
- ❌ Only 10 building types (SimTower had 20+)
- ❌ No long-term goal (cathedral unlock)
- ❌ Getting stuck with no money feels hopeless
- ❌ Not enough variety in challenge (only elevator management)

## Comparison to SimTower (1994)

| Feature | SimTower | OpenTower v0.5.0 | Winner |
|---------|----------|------------------|--------|
| Building Variety | 20+ types | 10 types | SimTower |
| Elevator Logic | LOOK algorithm | LOOK algorithm | Tie |
| Stress System | Yes | Yes (better visuals) | OpenTower |
| Save/Load | Buggy | Robust | OpenTower |
| Tutorial | None | 4-step interactive | OpenTower |
| Graphics | Isometric pixel art | Colored rectangles | SimTower |
| End-game Goal | Cathedral | None yet | SimTower |
| UX/Controls | Clunky | Modern | OpenTower |
| Sound | Dings only | Synthesis system | OpenTower |
| Day/Night | No | Yes (gradient sky) | OpenTower |

**Overall:** OpenTower has better UX/systems but lacks SimTower's variety and visual charm.
